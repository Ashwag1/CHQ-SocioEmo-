# CHQ-SocioEmo-
General public, often called consumers, are increasingly seeking health information through different online resources over the internet. To be satisfactory, answers often have to go beyond informational needs. Automated approaches to consumer health question answering should be able to recognize the need for social and emotional support. Recently, large scale datasets have addressed the issue of medical question answering and highlighted the challenges associated with question classification from the standpoint of informational needs. However, there is a lack of annotated datasets for the non-informational needs. We introduce a new dataset for non-informational support needs, called CQA-SocioEmo. The Dataset of Consumer Health Questions was collected from a community question answering forum and therefore it is a valuable resource for understanding non-informational support needs in consumer health-related questions online. We benchmark the corpus against multiple state-of-the-art classification models to demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness.
